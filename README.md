# Pokedex Service

This service uses https://pokeapi.co/ and https://api.funtranslations.com API to create a fun application for young children.

## Hello team

My name is Saarang Tiwari and I am the developer who developed this application.

## How to run the project

- Load **Pokedex.postman_collection.json** from root directory in your postman to view all the pre added APIs

### Using Nodejs

1. Globally installed Nodejs{V-12} [Prerequisite]
2. Go to the root folder
3. Run command: `npm install` [Downloads all the required libraries for the project Pokedex]
4. Run command: `npm run compile-once` [Compiles the typescript code & generates javascript]
5. Run command: `npm run start` [Runs the compiled server.js file from dist directory]

### Using Docker

1. Run Docker hub on the machine
2. Go to the root directory of the project
3. Run command: `docker build -t pokedex-docker .` [This builds the docker image]
4. Run command: `docker run -p3000:3000 pokedex-docker` [This runs the server and opens 3000(Nodejs server) port of container to 3000 port of host machine]

## APIS

**BASE_URL**: http://localhost:3000

### 1. Health Check

- URL: **/ping**

* Request type: `GET`

- Response:
  `PONG!!`

### 2. Get Basic Pokemon Information

- URL: **/pokemon/:name**

* url-params:
  - name: pokemon's name
* Request type: `GET`

- Response:

  ```javascript
  {
    "data": {
        "name": "mewtwo",
        "habitat": "rare",
        "isLegendary": true,
        "description": "It was created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments."
    },
    "message": "ok",
    "error": 0
  }

  ```

### 3. Get Translated Pokemon Information

- URL: **/pokemon/translated/:name**

* url-params:
  - name: pokemon's name
* Request type: `GET`

- Response:

  ```javascript
    {
        "data": {
            "name": "mewtwo",
            "habitat": "rare",
            "isLegendary": true,
            "description": "Created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and dna engineering experiments,  it was."
        },
        "message": "ok",
        "error": 0
    }

  ```

* Meaning of error & message:

  - If the `error = 0` :- it is a successful response

  - Else there is an error :- check message in the response to understand the reason

  - In the case of error data is {} else it has the response data

* Below is an example of Failed Response:

  ```javascript

      {
        data: {},
        message: 'Pokemon not found',
        error: 3,
      }

  ```

## Running tests

- Run command: `npm run test`: This will use `mocha` to run the tests.

- Unit test files are structured in the services folder along with the respected service file.

- Example file name: `filename.service.spec.ts` is the unit test file of `filename.service.ts`

## What would have I done in case of production release

- I would keep `.env` file for maintaining environment variables. Currently config.ts file has variables pointing to `process.env`

- I would use production api for fun translator service as the current one has rate-limiting

- A CI/CD can be setup for running test cases and on a successful run we can deploy the services

- I would create separate branches for `development` | `staging` | `production` to keep separate deployment strategies

- I would create separate environments within postman collection. [Didn't do that in this case as there was only one variable and no environments]
