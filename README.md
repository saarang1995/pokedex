# Pokedex Service

This service uses https://pokeapi.co/ and https://api.funtranslations.com API to create a fun application for young children.

## Hello team

My name is Saarang Tiwari and I am the developer who built this application.

## How to run the project

### Using Nodejs

1. Globally installed Nodejs -> version 12
2. Go to the root folder
3. Run command: `npm install` [Downloads all the required libraries for the project Pokedex]
4. Run command: `npm run compile-once` [Compiles the code, converts typescript into javascript]
5. Run command: `npm run start` [Runs the compiled server.js file from dist directory]
6. Load **Pokedex.postman_collection.json** from root directory in your postman and enjoy running the server

### Using Docker

1. Run Docker hub on the machine
2. Go to the root directory of the project
3. Run command: `docker build -t pokedex-docker .` [This builds the docker image]
4. Run command: `docker run -p3000:3000 pokedex-docker` [This runs the server and opens 3000(Nodejs server) port of container to 3001 port of host machine]
5. Load **Pokedex.postman_collection.json** from root directory in your postman and enjoy running the server

            "isLegendary": true,
            "description": "Created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and dna engineering experiments,  it was."
        },
        "message": "ok",
        "error": 0
    }

* Meaning of error messages:

  - If the `code = 0` then it is a successful response,

  - Otherwise there is an error, check message in the response to understand the reason.

  - In the case of error data is {}

Below is an example of error:

```javascript

    {
      data: {},
      message: 'Pokemon not found',
      code: 3,
    }

```
